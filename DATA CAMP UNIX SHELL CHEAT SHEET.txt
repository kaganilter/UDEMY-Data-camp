UNIX SHELL FOR DATA SCIENCE
* To find out where you are in the filesystem, run the command pwd (short for "print working directory
* To find out what's there, type ls (which is short for "listing"
* No matter where you are, ls ~ will always list the contents of your home directory, and cd ~ will always take you home.
* to copy a file cp, into the same directory or to the assigned file
* mv moves it from one directory to another, also renames a file
* .. always refers to the directory above your current location)
* rm deletes the file
* rmdir removes directories, For added safety, it only works when the directory is empty, so you must delete the files in a directory before you delete the directory. 
* Since a directory is not a file, you must use the command mkdir directory_name to create a new (empty) directory
* view a file's contents? cat , to view piece by piece, less, more 
* :n  moves to the next file. :p previous, :q  quits
* tab completion, type some words press tab and rest comes
* ls -R  to see everything underneath a directory, 
* ls -F prints a / after the name of every directory and a *after the name of every runnable program
* Help command: man
* head and tail select rows, cut selects columns, and grep selects lines according to what they contain
* cut -f 2-5,8 -d , values.csv  => select columns 2 through 5 and columns 8, using comma as the separator
* press the up-arrow key to cycle back through them
* paste that can be used to combine data files instead of cutting them up.
* store a command's output in a file? head -n 5 seasonal/summer.csv it prints the first 5 lines of the summer data on the screen. 
* Select the last two lines from seasonal/winter.csvand save them in a file called bottom.csv.
    * tail -n 2 seasonal/winter.csv > bottom.csv
* 
    * Select the first line from bottom.csv in order to get the second-to-last line of the original file.
        * head -n 1 bottom.csv
* The pipe symbol  “I “ tells the shell to use the output of the command on the left as the input to the command on the right.
    * head -n 5 seasonal/summer.csv | tail -n 3
* The command wc (short for "word count") prints the number of characters, words, and lines in a file, using -c, -w, or -l
* shell has many wildcards, * , ? matches a single character (01?.txt will match 2017.txt or 2018.txt), [...] matches any one of the characters inside the square brackets, , {...} matches any of the comma-separated patterns inside the curly brackets, so {*.txt, *.csv} matches any file whose name ends with .txt or .csv, but not files whose names end with .pdf.
* sort puts data in order.
* Ctrl + C stops the running program (not typing, pressing)
*  To find a variable's value is to use a command called echo
* To create a shell variable, you simply assign a value to a name:
* Shell variables are also used in loops
	for filetype in gif jpg png; do echo $filetype; done
* for ...variable... in ...list... ; do ...body... ; done
* If you type nano filename, it will open filename for editing (or create it if it doesn't already exist
    * Ctrl + K: delete a line.
    * Ctrl + U: un-delete a line.
    * Ctrl + O: save the file ('O' stands for 'output’).
    * Ctrl + X: exit the editor.
*  cp seasonal/s* ~  copies the files starting with s—
*
